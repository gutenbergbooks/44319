<p>Any person with but half an
eye could recognize at a glance
the extraordinary character of
Miss Myra Heck! And furthermore,
if novelists did not show
such decided preferences for
white-skinned heroines, Miss Heck
would long since have won the
world-wide renown which of right
belongs to her. But, unfortunately,
Miss Myra was born of
black parents away down in the
sunny southland, and the dark hue
of skin and wisps of woolly curls
which are characteristic of the
negro race have descended upon
their offspring. This is the more
unfortunate in that this daughter&mdash;now
a young woman of twenty-four
or thereabouts&mdash;is possessed
of really uncommon talents, while
her brain teems at all times with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
schemes worthy of a French diplomat;
and were she fair and
dainty as to exterior, she would
not now be occupying the situation
of "maid of all work" in the
little town where we first discovered
her.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding the accidental
disadvantages which hamper
this bright maid, she has
managed to achieve at least local
distinction in more directions than
one. Few families are there in
Rexville who have not at one time
or another availed themselves of
Miss Heck's services. Servants
of any degree of ability are exceedingly
rare in Rexville, so that
Miss Myra could easily reign as
the bright particular star in the
domestic firmament of the universe,
were it not for certain peculiarities
of temperament, added to
an ugly habit of prevaricating,
together with a too confident disposition
to presume upon her mistress'
willingness to permit her
cook to parade the streets dressed
in silks and satins from her own
wardrobe.</p>

<p>But, because of this scarcity of
help, and in view of the general
ability possessed by Miss Heck,
her employers have shut their eyes
to such peccadillos as these so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
often, that by dint of much experience
the young woman has at
last possessed herself of such
power that she rules the mistresses
of Rexville with a rod of iron.
She has indeed reached the conclusion
that although one family
may decide to forego the benefit
of her assistance in their household
because of some little peculiarity
of hers, nevertheless she is
sure of a position with some other
lady on the street before twenty-four
hours shall have sped. So
she oscillates back and forth&mdash;like
a pendulum&mdash;from one kitchen to
another throughout the length and
breadth of Rexville. Her period
of tarrying varies according to the
blindness of her mistress and the
condition of the master's pocket-book,
for this latter article shortly
feels the drain of Miss Myra's extravagant
habits, and sooner or
later collapses into empty space.
Then self-defense demands that
the sable goddess of the cuisine
depart to new fields and pastures
green until such time as self-denial
and rigid economy shall have once
more filled the purse, and brought
a return of the prosperity which
had been temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>Thus you see that even though
Miss Heck has not attained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
national reputation of which she is
worthy, she has at least in one
small corner of the earth won for
herself glory and renown. In this
little town, if nowhere else, her
name is a household word. It is
difficult to draw a correct word
picture of this wily maid; her
talents, too, are so numerous and
varied that one hesitates which to
portray first. Possibly, we can
convey a better idea of her personality
if we describe one particular
scheme of hers and its outcome.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the day before Thanksgiving,
in the year of our Lord
1892, and Miss Myra sat upon the
floor of her mother's dingy little
parlor deeply absorbed in thought.
She was working just at present
for banker Holmes' people, but
fortunately for herself the entire
family had gone east a week before
Thanksgiving in order to eat
turkey in good old-fashioned comfort
with relatives not seen for
months. This left Miss Myra free
to enjoy life to the uttermost. To
be sure she carried the key to the
big house in her pocket, and daily
went through the pretense of airing
and then dusting the premises. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
also had access to the cold storage
room, which privilege augmented
greatly the bill of fare at her
father's shanty. Her parents had
since earliest childhood greatly
admired their offspring, and this
ability of hers to vary the supply
and quality of their edibles on occasion
did not at all diminish this
fond regard.</p>

<p>Miss Myra had enjoyed her
freedom now for seven whole
days; she had walked the streets
at morning, noon and night,
dressed always in her best, and
this best was no mean style, for
the young woman was possessed
of a figure neat and trim, while
every cent of her earnings went
into clothes with which she might
easily outshine the rest of the
working girl population of Rexville.
She had, during these past
seven days, neither baked nor
swept, set the table, or made the
beds for anybody. In fact, she
had lived an existence of unalloyed
pleasure which comes from
that idleness so dear to the African
heart. But now she owned&mdash;to
herself, at least&mdash;that she was
tired. The dull monotony wearied
her.</p>

<p>What could she do to create a
new sensation? she asked herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
while she sat with her feet crossed
under her, tailor-fashion, upon the
bare floor. One dingy brown
hand, with its hue of pallor on the
palm, moved restlessly to and fro
through her crown of wool and
roughened its carefully plastered
locks until they stood out in grotesque
tangles all about her head.
At length a bright idea occurred
to her; she laughed aloud; a merry
chime of bells could not make
sweeter music. "I'se hit it this
time, sure, mammy," she called
out to the woman who was bending
over a steaming tub in an outer
room. Her mother wiped her
hands hastily upon the skirt of
her gown and went into the parlor
where Miss Myra yet sat upon
the floor.</p>

<p>"Hit what, chile? What mischief
has you got in dat hed of
yourn dis time, I'd like to know?"
she asked eagerly, as she threw
her ponderous body into a chair.
"Grand scheme, mammy; the best
I'se had yet," announced the girl,
as she slowly untangled her feet
from beneath her dress and rose
from the floor.</p>

<p>"It's bound ter be a first rate
one den shuah enough, Myrie," the
woman said admiringly, as she
watched the supple form stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
itself to relieve the cramped feeling
of the limbs caused by her
long continued crouching attitude.</p>

<p>"What you goin' do dis time,
chile? tell your poor old mammy,"
the negress went on, seeing the
young woman made no haste to
unbosom herself of her scheme.</p>

<p>"Wall, then, old lady, if you
<i>must</i> know, here goes! but don't
let it take your bref away," the
girl replied with provoking deliberateness,
and she crossed the
room to where a small cracked
mirror hung upon the wall; here
she proceeded to re-arrange her
hair, holding the pins in her
mouth as she did so, tantalizing
yet further the anxious mother.
"The longer you wait, the better
it'll seem, mammy," Miss Myra
said after a few moments. The
old lady made no reply; she always
let "Myrie" have her own way;
she had found by experience that
it was not easy to do otherwise.
At length even the critical taste of
Miss Myra seemed satisfied with
the vision she beheld in the little
glass, for she turned away with a
contented sigh, as she did so exclaiming,
"I'se gwine to give a
Thanksgiving party here, mammy,
tomorrer night! And it'll be a
swell affair, tew, take my wurd for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
it!" Then she put on her coat and
hat, blew a kiss from the ends of
her fingers toward the old negress
yet sitting stupid with amazement
in the rickety rocking-chair,
and with another ringing, happy
laugh went out into the storm. The
sky was lead-colored, the wind
blew fiercely and flung the snowflakes
which were falling rapidly
with spiteful force against the girl,
until her heavy garments were
soon hidden by a soft covering of
white. But not even the fleecy
crystals of snow had power to
change the hue of the ebony face,
and Miss Myra, who was a sensitive
young woman, could not but feel
a sensation of disgust as she
thought, "I must look blacker than
ever by contrast."</p>

<p>On down the street she walked
rapidly; here and there she paused
long enough at some house to leave
an invitation for the cook or coachman
to attend her Thanksgiving
party; but at the end of two hours
this part of her preparation was
ended.</p>

<p>It was time, then, she decided, to
turn her attention to further details
of her audacious plan; and
retracing her steps she soon
found herself at banker Holmes'
door. Here she entered, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
long time busied herself with necessary
preparations for the morrow's
festivities. As twilight fell,
she closed the house once more
and walked rapidly homeward.
That she had not been idle, the
next night's feast would show.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Any one passing by Jim Heck's
tumbled-down cottage Thanksgiving
night would have been astonished
at the number of gleaming
lights flashing out upon the snow
through the cracked and grimy
window-panes, and would have
stopped for a moment to listen to
the sounds of revelry within
doors. A fiddle squeaked in a
lively, even if discordant fashion,
while a banjo made frantic efforts
to keep it company. There was a
sound, too, as if of many feet
dancing an old-fashioned break-down,
which made the shanty
fairly tremble under the unwonted
strain upon its frail supports.</p>

<p>The aroma of hot coffee also
floated out upon the crisp air,
mingled with an odor of more
substantial viands, which appealed
strongly to the imagination of a
passing tramp who had paused to
look through a window void of
shade or curtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the dance ended; the
music ceased with one last unearthly
squeak, and for the space
of a single moment almost perfect
silence reigned, and then it seemed
as though just previously a cyclone
of noise had been running
riot.</p>

<p>At this juncture from the doorway
of the combined dining-room
and kitchen the host himself announced
in his most gracious
manner, "Supper am suhved, ladies
and gemmin; choose youah
pardners and walk out!"</p>

<p>With one hand he pulled down
the draperies which had been improvised
for the occasion, and
which had so far kept the glories
of the feast hidden from view;
whilst with the other he politely
motioned his guests to cross the
hospitable threshold. For a second
nobody stirred; a bashfulness as
sudden as it was unusual seemed
to have seized old and young
alike. Then a tall mulatto took
his late "partner" by the arm and
made a hasty exit into the supper
room. This was the signal for a
general stampede for seats; but
when the full glories of the scene
impressed themselves upon the
senses of the bewildered guests,
each and all stood as if rooted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the spot, staring with eyes and
mouth wide open at the unexpected
grandeur.</p>

<p>At the head of the table stood
Miss Myra herself. But such a
Miss Myra! Accustomed to see
her always in the latest style, they
had, "up to date," never beheld
her attired like this.</p>

<p>Solomon in all his glory, the
lilies of the field in their beauty,
were as nothing compared to
her!</p>

<p>She wore a trained robe of
richest ivory satin, elaborately
trimmed with point lace; the
dusky neck and arms shone like
polished ebony against the glimmering
sheen of the satin.</p>

<p>She stood perfectly silent for a
moment, her head uplifted, and
with a haughty smile upon her
lips, did her utmost to impress
these humble admirers with this
transitory grandeur.</p>

<p>"Yes, it jis' is indeed Mis
Holmes' weddin' dress, nuffin'
else, you simpletons," she said
calmly, as if announcing the most
commonplace fact. "An' dis yeah
is her linen, and dat's her coffee;
and it's her silber, too," she added
calmly, as she moved her hands
here and there, pointing out the
objects which she named. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
dat is nobody's business but mine;
you uns has nuffin' to do but enjoy
de good things I'se provided.
Sit down, goosies, and let der
feast proceed," she commanded
in an imperious manner, and set
the example by seating herself&mdash;with
due regard for her long-trained
gown&mdash;at the head of the
table.</p>

<p>This proceeding elicited tumultuous
applause, and from that moment
until the gray dawn began
to lighten the east, the fun was
fast and furious.</p>

<p>Of all races in the world
none can equal the African in its
abandon of enjoyment. From the
far-off homes of their ancestors,
where the tropical sun forces
vegetation into luxuriance and
raises the blood to well-nigh fever
heat, the negroes of the South
have derived the power to live in
and for the present only. "Foolish!"
you say? Well, probably.
Yet, after all, how much of human
wretchedness results from either
idle regrets for an unalterable
past, or causeless care for an undiscoverable
future? Be this as
it may, at Miss Myra's Thanksgiving
party shouts of laughter,
bursts of negro melody, the shuffling
of feet, all these sounds became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
more and more tumultuous
as the night waned.</p>

<p>In the early morning dusky
forms might have been seen entering
many a back or side door
in Rexville, and many a mistress
complained that day of inattention
to duty; but the darkies
never told the secret of their all-night
festivities.</p>

<p>For many and many a day the
glories of Miss Heck's Thanksgiving
party lingered in the minds
and on the tongues of the favored
guests.</p>

<p>Upon the return of the banker's
wife, that worthy lady found all
her belongings in the same condition,
apparently, as when she left
home. Miss Myra was shrewd
enough to skillfully effect this
result, and if ever her conscience
troubled her in reference to her
late "grand ball," she always
quieted its qualms by saying:
"What Mis Holmes don't know
ain't gwine ter hurt her none!
'Tain't right ter be selfish in dis
wurld noway! If der Lawd don't
make no ekal division of things,
why I'll jes have ter help, an' dat's
all ther is about hit!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It must have been at least a
year after the occurrence before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the banker's wife learned of the
party at which her possessions
had played so very conspicuous
and magnificent a part; and by
this time Miss Heck had left her
employ, being maid of all work
at the parsonage, and hence beyond
all need of censure from
outsiders, since it was perfectly
evident that her reverend employer
was trying to convert this
Topsy (up to date) from the error
of her ways and to pluck one
more brand from the burning,
adding yet another jewel to his
anticipated dazzlingly brilliant
crown.</p>

<p>But at last accounts the worthy
man's efforts had not met with
that measure of success which
usually have crowned his ministrations.
Miss Heck appears to
be a rather difficult "subject."</p>

<p>Topsy yet reigns over all the
mistresses of Rexville, and condescends
to work for them all in
turn.</p>

<p>Her impartiality is sublime!<br /><br /></p>
